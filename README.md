#Spotilist

Being unimpressed by the playlist organizing functionality in the Spotify Client,
this tool should be able to improve the situation. 

##Goals

###Chronological Organizaion
While Spotify provides the ability to sort a playlist, this doesn't allow the user
any flexibility in the ordering. I'd like the ability to specify a range of tracks
that will be sorted by the order added (eg: chronosort the 100 most recently added
tracks). Currently by default sort order is reverse chronological. I dislike this.

###More as Needed...
